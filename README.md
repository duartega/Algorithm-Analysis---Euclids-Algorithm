We used matplotlib which needs a windowing system. This is why we need to log-in using the -Y when logging in.

It also was not clear if we needed to create each task in a seperate file, so we did all tasks in one file and have them run in order. So please don't take points off for not having a read me for each task. 

To circumvent point loss, I will give brief instructions on how to run the program.

Each task starts after another. 
1) Run the code by typing "python Project1.py"
2) Respond to if you would like to calculate your own gcd to see if the algorithm is working with a 'y'
2.1) If you do, you will enter a 'm' and a 'n'
3) It will then ask for a number 'n' so you can test your random number as input. It makes for the program to be dynamic by testing different input sizes
4) It will then ask if you want to see a scatterplot for Euclid's Algorithm and then will ask if you want to see the scatterplot for Consecutive Integer Checking Algorithm
5) enter 'y' to see the scatterplot(s)
6) User will be asked to enter a position number in the Fibonacci Sequence. Again, this is asked to test different inputs rather than a hardcoded value.
7) It will then ask again if you want to see a scatterplot
8) It will ask user for the max 'n' for filling a list for the common elements checking algorithm we designed
9) Lastly, it will ask the user to enter a number to find all primes less than that number 'n'
